<h1>Work</h1>

<p>I would consider myself a workaholic. I have two jobs, and they definitely keep me busy along with school. One job is technically an internship (however it's paid) with Fairpoint Communications. I was only supposed to work there for the summer, but they decided they wanted to extend my internship! My second job (my primary job) is Tj Maxx. I have been with the company for almost three years, and I love every second of it. I would much rather prefer working with the public than doing the computer work that I do at Fairpoint. I've also met some of my lifelong friends at my jobs. Below you'll see a few pictures of my Tj's crew. Don't let the top right picture fool you, we love our jobs! </p>
